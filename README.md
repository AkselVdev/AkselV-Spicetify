# Spicetify Extensions

- ## [Vinyl Cover](https://github.com/AkselVdev/AkselV-Spicetify/blob/b34d12b82e2e15ea061f568d94f86da6ab60455e/Extensions/vinylcover.js)
  **Description:** Vinyl LP added behind the album cover of the current track. It spins when the track is playing, and stops when the track is paused. When hovering over the track's album cover, the vinyl shows more, and when not hovering, it's only slightly visible.
